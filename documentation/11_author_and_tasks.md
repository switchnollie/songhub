# Authors and Tasks

Since we are a group of only two people, we both worked on pretty much every file in the app. This applies to research, implementation and follow-up. We described in all relevant files of the app who was author and who was co-author (see *songhub* folder in main directory) like this:

~~~
// Copyright 2020 Pascal Schlaak, Tim Weise. Use of this source
// code is governed by an MIT-style license that can be found in
// the LICENSE file or at https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.
/// Authors: Pascal Schlaak, Tim Weise
~~~

In the following we have tried to roughly divide who initiated which functionality. 

### App Tasks
##### Tim Weise
* Cloud Functions
* App architecture
* Backend service APIs
* Authentication

##### Pascal Schlaak
* Recording and discussion feature functionality
* Presentational widgets
* Native widgets (file and image picker, audio player)
* Styling and design system
