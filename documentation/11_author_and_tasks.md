# Authors and Tasks

Since we are a group of only two people, we both worked on pretty much every file in the app. This applies to research, implementation and follow-up.

This is documented in the licence header that is used in every source code file that was written by us:

~~~
// Copyright 2020 Pascal Schlaak, Tim Weise. Use of this source
// code is governed by an MIT-style license that can be found in

~~~

The following is an attempt to roughly sketch out the main competencies by person:

### App Tasks
##### Tim Weise
* Cloud Functions
* App architecture
* Backend service APIs
* Authentication

##### Pascal Schlaak

* Presentational widgets
* Native widgets (file and image picker, audio player)
