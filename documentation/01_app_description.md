# App Description

### Problem and Opportunity

Professional musicians usually create a lot of ideas and iterate on a big set of song projects with their partners. 

Often times this creative process is unstructured and supported by various different tools which leads to problems in communication.

An example would be that a musician sends the current version of his song project to his producer and the producer mixes the newest version up with a different version because his inbox is messed up by so many versions.

These issues originate from the fact that there is no project management platform for persons in the musical industry. 

Song Hub is the first step towards such a musical project management tool.

#### Our Solution
Song Hub currently offers two main features: Song project versioning and song collaboration.

With versioning, both the producer and the song writer have a central place for storing audio files i.e. their different recordings for their projects as the songs progresses. This eliminates many problems that occur in actual project situations in which the exchange of the songs is based around email communication or traditional cloud storage providers. E.g. there is no chance that a new song version gets lost in an email inbox that is not suited for project file exchange. 

Furthermore, song collaboration features are provided such as a discussion area that is specific to a song project. The discussion area is designed to be used alongside with the recording versions so that one can always refer directly to a specific version in the creation process.

##### Stakeholders

The music industry is dominated by the three major labels Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group. Furthermore there are many independent labels.

Professional musicians that are signed by a label are usually in constant exchange with various producers, A&R managers, and other musicians. 

All these stakeholders benefit from our solution.

### App Features

#### Released features

The App currently offers user authentication with email and password, a song project view, a discussion area, a recording version area, a minimalistic audio player and a user profile area.

Our next steps would be filtering and pagination for song projects and recording versions, push notification support and a dedicated feed view.
