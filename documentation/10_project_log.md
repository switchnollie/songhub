## Exploratory Sprint

#### Date

29.04.2020 - 13.05.2020

#### Members
* Pascal Schlaak (MLD)
* Tim Weise (MIN)

### What did we accomplish?
After getting our idea approved, we started to set up our development environment consisting of **Adobe XD** as Wireframe/Prototyping tool, **Visual Studio Code** as an Editor.

#### Discuss competitive analysis
In our competitive analysis, we found the following competitors:

* Songspace
* Jammber
* Synchtank
* Soundgizmo
* Auddly

Pain points:

* They focus on commercial view
* Cloud data hub for projects
* Defining and calculating splits of participants
* General versioning of song progress

Our unique selling points:

* We want to focus on the creative perspective
* Feature to dicuss the current version of song/components of song with participants
* More detailed versioning of songs/components


#### Wireframes
In our first wireframing approaches we accomplished:

* First iteration of wireframe consisting of stock material design elements
* Second iteration of wireframe simplifying layout (reduced hirarchy, removed unnecessary elements, ...)
* First system run

### What hinderances/risks did/do we face?
* Two Group members left because the other students chose different courses &rightarrow; Only two participants
* Different development environments (MacOS, Ubuntu, Sketch, XD, Android studio, VS Code, ...)


### What do we plan to tackle in the next sprint?
1. Improve wireframing
2. Setup flutter project and get more into technologies
3. Elaborate architecture

#### Integrate functionality

![First functionality](./imgs/20200527_song_overview.png)

### What hinderances/risks did/do we face?

* Multi-platform development often resulted in errors after pulling changes and building for other os.
* Build process for iOS takes much longer than expected which is a document bug in Flutter Fire.


### What do we plan to tackle in the next sprint?

Demo core functionality:

* Integrate core feature(s)
	* Add/edit song
	* Prio B: Discussion
* Add more dummy data


## Alpha Sprint

#### Date

27.05.2020- 10.06.2020

#### Members

* Pascal Schlaak (MLD)
* Tim Weise (MIN)

### What did we accomplish?

We integrated user authentication to later allow multi user collaborations. Songs are now mapped to a user/owner. We added security rules in Firestore and Storage to restrict access.  A user can now register or sign in to the app by email and password. A user can now add new song projects and edit existing songs projects.  While editing a song a user can enter required files and add a cover image from the OS device gallery. We also refactored the data stream to fetch song objects. Details of a song now contain files, which are also fetched from dummy data in Firestore. Several front end components for the discussion feature were added too.

#### Integrate main technologies

Our main features exist of user authentication, data streams and song details.

### What hinderances/risks did/do we face?

* Database schema required multi stream concatenation &rightarrow;Â Refactored Firestore and Storage schema 
* Exceeding Storage free plan every afternoon due to too high data exchange

### What do we plan to tackle in the next sprint?

Feature complete:

- Implement all features (mostly backend services)
- Finish "Add Song" and "Edit Song"

### What hinderances/risks did/do we face?

* Due to our team constellation, we had much afford to realize full feature functionality 
* Poor Flutter Firebase documentation for specific features
* Difficulties in extending the app architecture for use cases that are not fully standard use cases intended by the Firebase APIs


### What do we plan to tackle in the next sprint?

- Create documentation
- Testing and debugging features
- Polish app including UI
- Prepare for certification and submission
