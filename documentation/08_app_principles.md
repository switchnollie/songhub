# App Principles



##### Lecture notes 2, page 24

We have tried to consistently apply the Confirm/Acknowledge concept presented here to dialogs in our app.

##### Lecture notes 4, page 15 - 16

We have designed our custom widgets strongly according to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.

##### Lecture notes 5, page 3 - 6

We have tried to integrate as much as possible of the presented concepts and guidelines regarding UX into our app. Our app uses existing concepts combined with up-to-date and functional design, which displays pleasant animations in places with loading time.

##### Lecture notes 5, page 8

We have developed our application according to the user-centered design. In a research phase we defined our target group, personas, user requirements for the app and the environment. In a user flow diagram we have recorded which actions a user needs when using our app, in order to be able to specify our layout. 

##### Lecture notes 5, page 9 - 42

We use existing concepts for our app, such as a hierarchical navigation. We use a nested doll navigation for our main functionality, whereby we have a tabbed view in the app's start screen. We use a similar structure for our Add and Edit modals as on page 40 and a Table/List View for our song list. We designed and implemented our app in an iterative process. We started with a high fidelity wireframe, which also served as a first prototype for testing the app. Finally, we conducted tests during the evaluation phase to optimize user actions and avoid bugs.

##### Lecture notes 6, page 3 - 7

We use many different material widgets as the basis of our own customized components. Flutter's Material Widgets offer us the basis of our own customized components. Unification of the components provides us with consistent usage and design language. For example, we have developed our own App Bar, which looks similar on all screens and offers interfaces for different functionality.

##### Lecture notes 6, page 8 - 10

We are currently using a scroll-based layout in our song overview. For dropdown menus in our modals we use the concepts of Androids Floating Context Menus. We use custom designed buttons to confirm actions with backend functionality. We use dialogs to warn the user about actions with consequences that cannot be undone. This is mainly used for delete actions (see Song, Recording delete). We use floating context menus to present the user with a pre-selection of fixed inputs. We use this layout in all dropdown menus.

##### Lecture notes 6, page 11

We have been working a lot on the usability of our app. A user should intuitively know how to achieve something easily. The app should also be aesthetic to create a pleasant experience with the app. Concepts of the UX/Interaction Design were used to optimize usability and the look and feel.

##### Lecture notes 6, page 12

We have optimized our navigation so that you don't have to switch back to the Overview to edit a song in the detail view, for example, but can access it directly via an edit icon.

##### Lecture notes 6, page 14, 15, 16, 22, 24, 26, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35

We use a list view to display several song projects on the homepage of our app. We use a tab bar at the bottom of our app as navigation between profile, projects and notifications. Search forms are used to search for participants. A user can invite other members via their email in Song Modal. In our song overview songs are sorted alphabetically by title. For recordings and messages this is done according to their creation date. These concepts are used by many apps and are therefore common to many people. When designing our app, we paid great attention to usability, aesthetics, UX, information structure, accessibility and UCD. We have applied various techniques, explained on this lecture notes too.

### General Lecture Principles

##### Lecture notes 1, page 3, 11, 12

As can be seen in the source, mobile apps offer a large market. Therefore and through the lecture we decided to design our app for bigger mobile devices, which are the most common today. It would later still make sense to optimize our app for more devices.

##### Lecture notes 1, page 4, 13, 15

It makes sense to develop this app for the most used platforms. These are also the platforms with the most apps. 

##### Lecture notes 1, page 6

Our idea allows us to act in several areas of categories: Entertainment, social networking, music.

##### Lecture notes 1, page 7 - 9

With our idea, it would make sense to offer the app free of charge on the various platforms and generate revenue through a monthly subscription model. Users pay for the use of our services. This would also save us problems with other monetization methodologies, such as advertising.

##### Lecture notes 1, page 16 - 18, lecture notes 2, page 31 - 33

Since we haven't done anything with Flutter yet and this is a very hyped framework, we prefer to work with this cross platform framework.

##### Lecture notes 2, page 23

The Material guidelines shown on this slide help us to design our front end.

##### Lecture notes 2, page 28

We have tried to use the most popular Android versions here during our development on Android emulators.
