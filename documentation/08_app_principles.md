# App Principles

##### Lecture notes 1, page 3, 11, 12

As can be seen in the source, mobile apps offer a large market. Therefore and through the lecture we decided to design our app for bigger mobile devices, which are the most common today. It would later still make sense to optimize our app for more devices.

##### Lecture notes 1, page 4, 13, 15

It makes sense to develop this app for the most used platforms. These are also the platforms with the most apps. 

##### Lecture notes 1, page 6

Our idea allows us to act in several areas of categories: Entertainment, social networking, music.

##### Lecture notes 1, page 7 - 9

With our idea, it would make sense to offer the app free of charge on the various platforms and generate revenue through a monthly subscription model. Users pay for the use of our services. This would also save us problems with other monetization methodologies, such as advertising.

Since we haven't done anything with Flutter yet and this is a very hyped framework, we prefer to work with this cross platform framework.

The Material guidelines shown on this slide help us to design our front end.

##### Lecture notes 2, page 24

We have tried to consistently apply the Confirm/Acknowledge concept presented here to dialogs in our app.

##### Lecture notes 2, page 28

We have tried to use the most popular Android versions here during our development on Android emulators.

##### Lecture notes 4, page 15 - 16

We have designed our custom widgets strongly according to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.

##### Lecture notes 5, page 3 - 6

We have tried to integrate as much as possible of the presented concepts and guidelines regarding UX into our app. Our app uses existing concepts combined with up-to-date and functional design, which displays pleasant animations in places with loading time.

##### Lecture notes 5, page 8

We have developed our application according to the user-centered design. In a research phase we defined our target group, personas, user requirements for the app and the environment.

##### Lecture notes 5, page 9 - 42

We use existing concepts for our app, such as a hierarchical navigation. We use a nested doll navigation for our main functionality, whereby we have a tabbed view in the app's start screen. We use a similar structure for our Add and Edit modals as on page 40 and a Table/List View for our song list.

##### Lecture notes 6, page 3 - 7

We use many different material widgets as the basis of our own customized components.

##### Lecture notes 6, page 8 - 10

We are currently using a scroll-based layout in our song overview. For dropdown menus, for example, we use the concepts of Androids Floating Context Menus.

##### Lecture notes 6, page 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 22, 24, 26, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35

When designing our app, we paid great attention to usability, aesthetics, UX, information structure, accessibility and UCD. We have applied various techniques, explained on this lecture notes.
