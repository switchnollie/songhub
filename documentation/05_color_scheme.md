# Color scheme

Even though we used Material widgets for most of our base UI components, we decided not to use the Material color system but define a custom, minimalistic set of colors with only one accent color and a "danger-type" color to indicate errors.

The accent color is ultramarine blue and is used as primary color on button backgrounds, tab active indicators and status labels.

Furthermore there are two shades that are variations of that ultra marine blue for surfaces: Cadet Blue Crayola and Light Gray.

Both have almost the same hue value and a reduced saturation, in other words both can be created by blending in white into the ultramarine blue.
