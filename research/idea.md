# Idea
Central management tool for suppoting creative music developing process. App should have following features:

* Organize and add new song projects
* Upload new components (e.g. vocals, instrumentals, ...) of the song (versioning and labeling of current progress)
* Discuss current progress and new song components with involved entities (e.g. producer, ...)

## Problem
Current music managing tools focus on commercial point of music developing.

## Competetive analysis

### Auddly
[Auddly](https://auddly.com/) is a data hub to control songs and rights, split shares. User can add and update songs by adding different progresses.

##### Pain points
* Comment feature not suited for discussing sample
* Versioning too general. Can just label sample as current version, can't add and discuss components of song
* Focusses on commercial point of view


## Innovation
We want to focus on the creative process of making music by:

* Managing all details when working on new music (creators should be able to upload e.g. instrumentals, ... not only the current song status)
* Deploy messaging feature to discuss every component of a song with multiple entities
