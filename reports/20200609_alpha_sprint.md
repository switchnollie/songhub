# Alpha Sprint

## What did we accomplish?

We integrated user authentication to later allow multi user collaborations. Songs are now mapped to a user/owner. We added security rules in Firestore and Storage to restrict access.  A user can now register or sign in to the app by email and password. A user can now add new song projects and edit existing songs projects.  While editing a song a user can enter required files and add an cover image from device gallery. We also refactored the general data stream to fetch song objects. Details of a song now contain files, which are also fetched from dummy data in Firestore. Several front end components for the discussion feature were added too.
